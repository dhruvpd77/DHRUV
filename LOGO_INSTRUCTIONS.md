# Logo Installation Instructions

## Your QuizNJoy Logo Has Been Added! 🎓

I've updated all your templates to include the QuizNJoy logo. Here's what you need to do:

### Step 1: Save Your Logo
1. Save your QuizNJoy logo image file as `logo.png`
2. Place it in the following directory:
   ```
   C:\Users\Dhruv\Desktop\B4 QUIZ\static\images\logo.png
   ```

### Step 2: That's It!
The logo will now appear in the following locations:
- ✅ **Navigation Bar** (top of every page)
- ✅ **Footer** (bottom of every page)
- ✅ **Login Page** (left side panel)
- ✅ **Signup Page** (left side panel)
- ✅ **Quiz Results Page** (top of results)
- ✅ **Admin Dashboard** (header)

### Important Notes:
- The logo should be in **PNG format** with a transparent background for best results
- Recommended size: **512x512 pixels** (the templates will automatically resize it)
- The file MUST be named exactly: `logo.png`

### If You Need to Use a Different Format:
If your logo is in JPG, GIF, or another format, just update the filename in the templates:
- Search for: `'images/logo.png'`
- Replace with: `'images/logo.jpg'` (or your format)

### Testing:
After placing the logo file, run your Django server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Then visit any page and you should see your logo displayed!
